# üìÉ RussianRoulette

This repository has a Russian roulette for your computer, made in Python. The idea of the project is that a code will be generated between 1 and 6, and if it lands on 6, the 'system32' folder will be affected.


### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Execute the Python File "russian_roulette.py"

Open the terminal of your operating system.

Navigate to the directory where the "russian_roulette.py" file is saved. For example, if the file is saved on the desktop in a Windows operating system, you can navigate to the directory using the following command:

bash
Copy code
cd C:\Users\YourUser\Desktop
Replace "YourUser" with your computer's username.

Type the following command in the terminal to execute the file:

Copy code
python russian_roulette.py
Press Enter to execute the command.

The Python file "russian_roulette.py" will be executed, and the result will be displayed in the terminal.

Remember that Python must be installed on your computer to run the code. Also, keep in mind that running this code can be dangerous since it includes a feature that can affect the "system32" folder. Make sure you fully understand the code before running it and that you are aware of the risks involved.
